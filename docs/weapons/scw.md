# SC Weapons

## Description

### Empty Hands

This SWEP was created to mimic the 'no weapon' status.

### Fast Crowbar

This SWEP mimics HL2 Crowbar, but its attack speed is very fast.

I tried to mimic HL2 Crowbar as much as I could, but there can be a small difference between this SWEP and HL2 Crowbar.

### MP5SD

Basically, this is reskined SMG1. But its bullet spread is very small, and its damage is twice that of SMG1.

It also has the capability of converting Pistol ammo to SMG1 ammo when SMG1 ammo is depleted.

### SCAR20

This SWEP is based on SCAR20 from CS:GO but uses Crossbow Bolt as its ammunition and has 100% accuracy.

It also has the capability of converting AR2 ammo to Crossbow ammo when Crossbow ammo is depleted.
