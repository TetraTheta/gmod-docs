> *Just Another Crappy SWEPs*

I know there are tons of admin guns in the Garry's Mod Workshop. But I couldn't find any add-ons that fit my desire, so I decided to make my own version of the admin gun.

While doing that, I've also decided to make my own SWEPs that aren't admin guns too.

## Weapon List

### Missing hands in SCAR20

Hands are removed because I couldn't figure out how to fix these distorted hands. No hands would be better than this.
